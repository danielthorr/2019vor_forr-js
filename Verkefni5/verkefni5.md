#### Template:
In hindsight I feel like I should have implemented the template better. I used a single function to create everything then I removed and recreated everything once I needed to display the next question.
I would have liked to modify the code to have a template function inside a class and have the class store references to the elements. Then I could just switch out the text and attributes of the elements when I needed to display the next question.
